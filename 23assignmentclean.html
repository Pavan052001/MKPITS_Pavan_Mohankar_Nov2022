odor and to avoid the spreading of dirt and contaminants to oneself and others. In the case of glass objects such as windows or windshields,
 the purpose can also be transparency. Washing is one way of achieving cleanliness, usually with water[1] and often some kind of soap or detergent.
Since the germ theory of disease, it has also now means no germs and other waste. In industry, certain processes need conditions of exceptional 
cleanliness which are achieved by working in cleanrooms. To remove grime, loose paint, mud, mold, dust and other types of stubborn dirt, high
